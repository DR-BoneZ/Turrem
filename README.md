Turrem
======

Turrem is an upcoming Real Time Strategy game focused on building your nation from the beginnings of civilization all the way up to the modern era. Its dynamic world, creative focus, and unique mechanics promise an enjoyably deep experience. As we are still in the early stages of development, the game is currently open-source on GitHub, but an eventual release through Steam Greenlight would be our end goal.

###Nasty Version###
All libraries used by Turrem (i.e. LWJGL) are the property of their original creators. Turrem is the intellectual property of Sam Sartor. If you have contributed, the code you wrote or assets you have created are your intellectual property, but the binaries included with Turrem are not. If you have contributed significantly, then you should have made more specific agreement with me. DO NOT distribute any part of the source code for any version of Turrem outside of the original repository on GitHub or forks thereof. This may change when the repository is made private. DO NOT distribute any part of Turrem’s binaries for any version greater than 0.3 unless you have written permission to do so. These rules apply to any code within the “net.turrem” package.  Code from “net.turrem.utils” is exempt, and should be considered open source under an MIT license. The NBT format was created for Minecraft and is currently used by Mojang. Turrem uses NBT but does not use any of the code or any binaries from Mojang’s implementation of it. At the time of writing, Turrem’s source code is publicly available, but I reserve the right to make the repository private at any time. I also reserve the right to change these terms at any time. I also reserve the right to sell Turrem commercially. Turrem cannot be used commercially by anyone else unless an alternative agreement is made. I reserve the right to make exceptions to any of these terms for specific individuals or groups and to cancel these exceptions at any time. Because I am not a layer, and I am not confident that these terms are properly constructed, I reserve the right to declare any usage of Turrm’s code, binaries, assets, or brand in violation of my intellectual property within reason. If you are not sure about any part of these terms or your relationship to them, contact me at turremgame@gmail.com .
